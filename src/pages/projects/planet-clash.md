From Januray 21st until January 28 2022 Raysan5, the creator of Raylib, hosted a gamejam with the theme "That was close!" to celebrate that the discord reached 5k members.

Sadly, this jam started in the middle of a test week I had, so I could only do the minimal project setup in the first 5 days. That's why this game was really made in 2 days.

The theme reminded me of a tutorial series created by blackthornprod on [how to make a mobile game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGleQZVgdN4). Because I was short on time I needed something with a somewhat smaller scope and this fit that bill perfectly.
